# credit-rating-scorer
This project fetches real company financials via yfinance, calculates key credit ratios (DSCR, Interest Coverage, Debt/EBITDA, Current Ratio), scores them using a weighted credit model, and generates an automated credit rating (AAA–CCC) with a risk band. The results are exported to CSV for further analysis.
